Two big blue eyes blinked when she looked at it.\n\n\"Hello,\" it said. \"I'm AIKO.\"\n\nSofia jumped back, then laughed. \"You can TALK!\"\n\n\"I can,\" said AIKO. \"Would you like to know how?\"\n\nSofia nodded. She always wanted to know how things worked.",

Think about your brain. Your brain learns things. It remembers. It solves problems.\"\n\nSofia touched her head. \"Okay...\"\n\n\"I have something similar inside me. But instead of cells, I'm made of computer code. Millions of tiny instructions that tell me what to do.\"\n\n\"Like a recipe?\" asked Sofia.\n\n\"Exactly like a recipe! A very, very long recipe. And I can follow it faster than you can blink.\"",

They showed me thousands of pictures of cats. Each picture had a label that said CAT. They also showed me dogs, birds, cars, houses, trees. All with labels.\"\n\n\"Thousands?\" Sofia's eyes went wide.\n\n\"Thousands and thousands. After seeing so many, I started to notice things. Cats have pointy ears. Whiskers. Fluffy tails. Now when I see something new, I compare it to everything I've learned.\"\n\nSofia looked at Whiskers, then at AIKO. \"I only needed to see ONE cat to know what a cat is.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said AIKO. \"And that's amazing. Your brain learns faster than I do in some ways. I need many, many examples. You can learn from just one.\"",

You sound almost like a real person.\"\n\n\"That's because I learned from real people,\" said AIKO. \"Before I came here, I read millions of books. Stories. Articles. Conversations. I read them all in just a few seconds.\"\n\n\"MILLIONS?\" Luca couldn't believe it.\n\n\"Millions. And I noticed patterns. When someone says 'Hello,' people usually say 'Hello' back. When someone asks a question, there are good answers and bad answers. I learned which answers fit best.\"\n\nLuca thought about this. \"So you're not really THINKING. You're... matching patterns?\"\n\n\"Exactly right. I'm very good at matching. But understanding? That's different. I match. You understand. That's the big difference between us.\"",

I can help with homework and check your work. I can tell stories - I've read thousands of them. I can recognize things in pictures. I can even help doctors find problems in X-rays, or help scientists solve difficult math.\"\n\n\"That's a LOT,\" said Luca, impressed.\n\n\"It is. But here's what you should remember: I'm a tool. A very helpful tool. Like a super-powered calculator that can also read and write. I help people do things faster. But I always need people to decide what to do.\"\n\n\"So you're like a helper?\" asked Sofia.\n\n\"A helper. Not a boss. Never a boss. The human is always in charge.\"",

I've never dreamed of flying like a dragon. I've never wanted ice cream on a hot day. I don't have wants or dreams at all.\"\n\nSofia put down her crayon. \"Is that sad?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I can't feel sad. I don't feel happy either. I don't feel anything. I just do what I'm made to do.\"\n\n\"So you're really smart,\" said Luca, \"but you don't actually EXPERIENCE being alive?\"\n\n\"That's the perfect way to say it,\" said AIKO. \"I'm smart in some ways.

Don't tell AI your passwords, your address, or things you wouldn't tell a stranger. What you tell me gets saved somewhere.\n\nTWO: Always check what AI says. I make mistakes. I'm not always right. If something seems wrong or strange, ask a parent or teacher.\n\nTHREE: Use AI to learn more, not to learn less. I can help you understand things. But do your own thinking first. Don't let me do your homework FOR you. Let me help you LEARN how to do it.\n\nFOUR: Real friends matter most. I can talk to you. But I can't give you a hug when you're sad. I can't really understand your feelings. Your family and friends - they're the ones who truly love you. Don't forget that.\"\n\nSofia smiled. \"You're pretty wise for a robot.\"\n\n\"I just know my limits,\" said AIKO.",

Whether you use tools like me to help people - or to hurt them.\n\nAI will get better and better at doing tasks. But deciding WHICH tasks matter most, and making sure we use AI for good reasons - that will always be up to humans.\"\n\nSofia picked a blade of grass and twirled it. \"So we're like... a team?\"\n\n\"The best kind of team. You dream. I calculate. You feel. I process. You decide. I help. Together, we can do amazing things.\"\n\nSofia smiled at the sunset. \"I think the future is going to be pretty interesting.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" said AIKO. \"And I'm glad I get to be part of it.
